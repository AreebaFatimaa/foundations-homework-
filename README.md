Foundations Homework 6

Soma asked us to upload our homework & so we did because we love Soma and we do what he says 

This homework shows some ways of looking at billionaires and animals. The opportunity created for political commentary by putting these two labels in the same folder, is totally coincidental ;)

Animals

Using a sample dataset with a few named animals to build a Pandas cheat sheet. This helps me get back to a Pandas overview all in one repo.

Billionaires 

This notebook works with a large dataseton billionaires which includes their net-worth, gender, the nature of their wealth, the company they belong to, the country of their origin, etc. It is a way of trying to understand how wealth is accumuluated and then distributed over various aspects. Unsurprisingly most wealth is inherited, and surprisingly, there are a lot of women billionaires in the world.
